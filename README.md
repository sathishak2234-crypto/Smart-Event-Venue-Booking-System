**Smart Event Venue Booking System**

A web-based Smart Event Venue Booking System developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application allows users to view available venues, check booking availability, and reserve event spaces. The system uses browser localStorage to store booking data, so no database is required.

**Project Overview**

The Smart Event Venue Booking System is designed to:
Display available event venues
Allow users to book venues for specific dates
Prevent duplicate bookings
Store booking data locally in the browser
Provide a simple and user-friendly interface
This project is suitable for academic mini-project submissions and frontend web development practice.

**Features**

View multiple event venues
Select booking date
Enter customer details
Store data using localStorage
Prevent double booking for the same date
Responsive design
Simple and clean user interface

**Technologies Used**

HTML5 – Structure
CSS3 – Styling and layout
JavaScript (ES6) – Application logic and validation
localStorage – Client-side data storage

**How It Works**

The user selects a venue.
The user enters booking details such as name, date, and contact information.
The system checks localStorage for existing bookings.
If the venue is available for the selected date, the booking is confirmed.
If the venue is already booked for that date, an error message is displayed.
